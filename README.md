# Data was imported and first transformed in Power query, the data has four rows as seen on slide 3 i.e. Ship mode, Segment, Order date and Sales. Using DAX, Additional columns were created on the date table and quick measure adopted to calculate the necessary variables from the revenue such as Revenue Year to Date, Revenue Month over Month Variance, Revenue Month to Date, Revenue Same Period Last Year etc. The invoice provided focused on a period of four calendar years (2013-2016) and the analysis concentrated on the peak period (2016), establishing Sales relationship between same and other years. Data was simply modelled by establishing a relationship between the dimension table and the Date table after which data was analyzed and visualized to draw insight.
